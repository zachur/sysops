# The Big Book of Debian 
__Version 12.1.0 "bookworm" Release__  

This guide provides a step-by-step overview of my method for Debian installations. Its purpose is to streamline the process of performing fresh installs with consistency and efficiency. By following this document, you can quickly and reliably set up Debian on your system, ensuring a smooth and consistent experience every time.

##  Installation
### Major features: Graphical install, LVM, Xfce
As the first (and currently, only) method on the list, this section is intended to remain as a work-in-progress that is prone to change and it should be assumed that it will evolve over time to match my needs and reflect my level of expertise. Unless I fail to update this document, consider it likely reflects what I'm *actually* using on my PC(s).  

<br>

<br>

> Note: 



<br>
<br>
<br>

__The selected location will be used to set your time zone and also for example to help select the system locale. Normally this should be the country where you live.__

__This is a shortlist of locations based on the language you selected. Choose "other" if your location is not listed.__  

<u>*Country, territory or area:*</u>
- Select 'United States' option from 'Country, territory or area' list
- Click 'Continue' button (or, press 'Enter'/'Return' key)

<br>

> Note: 

<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>



### 8. [INTERSTITIAL] Detect network hardware

<br>

> Note: *This takes place automatically.*

<br>
<br>
<br>



### 9a. [INTERSTITIAL] Configure the network (Wired Connection)
*Using Network Cable...*

<br>

> Note: *This takes place automatically.*



<br>
<br>
<br>



### 9b. Configure the network (Wireless Connection)
*Using Wi-Fi...*

- Select the wireless network name
- Select the wireless network type
- Enter the wireless network passphrase

<br>

> Note: A loading bar appears, begins, completes, and disappears without the need for user input or intervention.



<br>
<br>
<br>



### 10. Configure the network (Hostname)
__Please enter the hostname for this system.__

__The hostname is a single word that identifies your system to the network. If you don't know what your hostname should be, consult your network administrator. If you are setting up your own home network, you can make something up here.__

<u>*Hostname:*</u>
- Enter a system hostname

<br>

> Note: I use 'debian-desktop' or 'debian-laptop' as a hostname.



<br>
<br>
<br>



### 11. Configure the network (Domain name)

__The domain name is the part of your Internet address to the right of your host name. It is often something that ends in .com, .net, .edu, or .org. If you are setting up a home network, you can make something up, but make sure you can use the same domain name on all your computers.__  

<u>*Domain name:*</u>
- Enter a domain name

<br>

> Note: I leave the domain name blank.



<br>
<br>
<br>



### 12. Set up users and passwords (Root password)
__You need to set a password for 'root', the system administrative account. A malicious or unqualified user with root access can have disastrous results, so you should take care to choose a root password that is not easy to guess. It should not be a word found in dictionaries, or a word that could be easily associated with you.__

__A good password will contain a mixture of letters, numbers and punctuation and should be changed at regular intervals.__

__The root user should not have an empty password. If you leave this empty, the root account will be disabled and the system's initial user account will be given the power to become root using the "sudo" command.__

__Note that you will not be able to see the password as you type it.__  

<u>*Root password:*</u>

...

__Please enter the same root password again to verify that you have typed it correctly.__

<u>*Re-enter password to verify*</u>

...

<br>

> Note: Toggle the 'Show Password in Clear' to view the entered password in plain text.
- If using a root password:
    - Minimum length of 20
    - Uppercase letters
    - Lowercase letters
    - Non-sequential numbers
    - Special characters



<br>
<br>
<br>



### 13. Set up users and passwords (Full name)
__A user account will be created for you to use instead of the root account for non-administrative activities.__

__Please enter the real name of this user. This information will be used for instance as default origin for emails sent by this user as well as any program which displays or uses the user's real name. Your full name is a reasonable choice.__  

<u>*Full name for the new user:*</u>
- Enter a full name for the user account 

<br>

> I use "User" as a full name.



<br>
<br>
<br>



### 14. Set up users and passwords (Username)
__Select a username for the new account. Your first name is a reasonable choice. The username should start with a lower-case letter, which can be followed by any combination of numbers and more lower-case letters.__  

<u>*Username for your account*</u>
- Enter a username for the user account

<br>

> I use "user" as a username.



<br>
<br>
<br>



### 15. Set up users and passwords (User password)
__A good password will contain a mixture of letters, numbers and punctuation and should be changed at regular intervals.__  

<u>*Choose a password for the new user:*</u>

...

- Enter a password for the user account

> I use a password with minimum length of 12 characters.

Please enter the same user password again to verify you have typed it correctly.

<u>*Re-enter password to verify:*</u>

...

<br>

> Note: After entering the user account password, a loading bar appears, begins, completes, and disappears without the need for further user input or intervention.*

<br>
<br>
<br>



### 16. Configure the clock
__If the desired time zone is not listed, then please go back to the step "Choose language" and select a country that uses the desired time zone (the country where you live or are located).__  

<u>*Select your time zone:*</u>
- Select local time zone (Central)

<br>

> Note:

<br>
<br>
<br>



### 17. [INTERSTITIAL] Detect disks
*This takes place automatically.*

<br>

Note:

<br>
<br>
<br>



### 18. Partition disks (Partitioning method)
__The installer can guide you through partitioning a disk (using different standard schemes) or, if you prefer, you can do it manually. With guided partitioning you will still have a chance later to review and customise the results.__

__If you choose guided partitioning for an entire disk, you will next be asked which disk should be used.__  

<u>*Partitioning method*</u>
- Guided - use entire disk and set up LVM
- Select the target disk to partition

    *For me, this is usually the /dev/nvme0n1 disk.*

- Separate /home, /var, and /tmp partition
- Finish partitioning and write changes to disk
- Select "Yes" in response to "Write the changes to disk?"

<br>

> Note: 

<br>
<br>
<br>



### 19. Partition disks (Select disk to partition)
__Note that all data on the disk you select will be erased, but not before you have confirmed that you relaly want to make the changes.__  

<u>*Select disk to partition:*</u>
/dev/nvme0n1 - 512.1 GB INTEL SSDPEKNU512GZ
SCSI11 (0,0,0) (sda) - 15.5 GB USB Disk 3.0

<br>

> Note: 

<br>
<br>
<br>



### 20. Partition disks (Partitioning scheme)
Selected for partitioning:

/dev/nvme0n1 - INTEL SSDPEKNU512GZ: 512.1 GB

The disk can be partitioned using one of several different schemes. If you are unsure, choose the first one.  

<u>*Partitioning scheme:*</u>
- Select a partitioning scheme
    - All files in one partition (recommended for new users)
    - Separate /home partition
    - Separate /home, /var, and /tmp partitions

<br>

> Note: I choose to separate /home, /var, and /tmp partitions.

<br>
<br>
<br>



### 21. Partition disks (Confirm partitioning)
__Before the Logical Volume Manager can be configured, the current partitioning scheme has to be written to disk. These changes cannot be undone.__

__After the Logical Volume Manager is configured, no additional changes to the partitioning scheme of disks containing physical volumes are allowed during the installation. Please decide if you are satisfied with the current partitioning scheme before continuing.__

__The partition tables of the following devices are changed:__
__/dev/nvme0n1__  

<u>*Write the changes to disks and configure LVM?*</u>
- Select 'Yes' then 'Continue' button

<br>

> Note: 

<br>
<br>
<br>



### 22. Partition disks (Remove existing logical volume data)
__The selected device already contains the following LVM logical volumes, volume groups and physical volumes which are about to be removed:__

__Logical volume(s) to be removed: home, root, swap_1, tmp, var__

__Volume group(s) to be removed: debian-desktop-vg__

__Physical volume(s) to be removed: /dev/nvme0n1p3__

__Note that this will also permanently erase any data currently on the logical volumes.__  

<u>*Remove existing logical volume data?*</u>
- Select 'Yes' then 'Continue' button

<br>

> Note:

<br>
<br>
<br>



### 23. Partition disks (Amount of volume group to use)
You may use the whole volume group for guided partitioning, or part of it. If you use only part of it, or if you add more disks later, then you will be able to grow logical volumes later using the LVM tools, so using a smaller part of the volume group at installation time may offer more flexibility.

The minimum size of the selected partitioning recipe is 8.3 GB (or 1%); please note that the packages you choose to install may require more space than this. The maximum available size is 511.1 GB.

Hint: "max" can be used as a shortcut to specify the maximum size, or enter a percentage (e.g. "20%") to use that percentage of the maximum size.  

<u>*Amount of volume group to use for guided partitioning:*</u>
- Choose and enter an amount to partition then 'Continue' button

<br>

> Note: I typically choose "50%" for my system(s).

<br>
<br>
<br>

__The partition tables of the following devices are changed:__<br>
__LVM VG debian-desktop-vg, LV home__<br>
__LVM VG debian-desktop-vg, LV root__<br>
__LVM VG debian-desktop-vg, LV swap_1__<br>
__LVM VG debian-desktop-vg, LV tmp__<br>
__LVM VG debian-desktop-vg, LV var__<br>

__The following partitions are going to be formatted:__<br>
__LVM VG debian-desktop-vg, LV home as ext4__<br>
__LVM VG debian-desktop-vg, LV root as ext4__<br>
__LVM VG debian-desktop-vg, LV swap_1 as swap__<br>
__LVM VG debian-desktop-vg, LV tmp as ext4__<br>
__LVM VG debian-desktop-vg, LV var as ext4__<br>
__partition #1 of /dev/nvme0n1 as ESP__<br>
__partition #2 of /dev/nvme0n1 as ext2__<br>

<br>

<u>*Debian archive mirror country:*</u>
- Select 'United States' then 'Continue' button

<br>

> Note:



<br>
<br>
<br>



### 29. Configure the package manager (Archive mirror)
